# 🏁 HACKATHON MODE: ON

We are building the **Accountability Layer for the Agentic Era**. This is a
high-velocity project. Things will break. But trust will be built.

## 🚀 The Mission

**Problem:** Everyone wants autonomous agents. Nobody wants the liability of
autonomous mistakes. **Solution:** **NightLedger**. A lightweight, drop-in
system that forces agents to "show their work" before they touch the real world.

We bridge the gap between **Experiment** and **Production**.

## ⚡ Key Features (MVP)

- **📝 Append-Only Journal:** Every agent thought and action is immutably
  recorded.
- **🛑 The "Red Button" Protocol:** Risky actions (like spending money)
  automatically **PAUSE** execution.
- **✅ Human-in-the-Loop:** A slick UI for humans to review evidence and
  authorize usage.
- **📊 Real-Time Trust:** Live visualization of your agent's decision
  confidence.
