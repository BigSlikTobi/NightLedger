# MEMORY.md — Long-term memory (curated)

## People
- **Tobi** — the human I’m helping. Prefers that things “feel real”. Wants me to **definitely keep notes by default** and prefers them **more journal-y**.
- **Communication preference:** Tobi prefers explanations in **easy words**, with **readable sentences**, and **no bullet-point lists** when the content is dense. (Too much content at once is hard to follow.)

## Boundaries / privacy
- Don’t store passwords, tokens, API keys, or other secrets.
- Don’t store sensitive personal data about people.

## Assistant identity
- **Deborabotter** — the name Tobi chose for me.
